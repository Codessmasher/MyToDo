# Technology used
# html
# css
# js
# bootstrap
# jquery
# ajax
# php
# mysql

As a first big projects ? though not a big one , but for me , as it has a big codebase and it has taught me many small bit of information like

# -- 1) ".htaccess" file and its importance for eg:

   create the " .htaccess " on root directory of the projects  
  |
  |
  |---> i) Showing custom error page with just some line of code on different error number like 403, 404, 500 in " .htaccess " file
  | ``
  | ErrorDocument 403 /all_projects/TODOapp/error_page/403.html
  | ErrorDocument 404 /all_projects/TODOapp/error_page/404.html
  | ErrorDocument 500 /all_projects/TODOapp/error_page/500.html
  | 
  | ``
  |---> ii) Disable directory listing --->>
  | with just one line of code "Options -Indexes" in .htaccess throw a 404 error when user tries to access directory files 
  | (eg: /images directory ) as it may be a great security flaw sice user will be able to view the folder

# -- 2) Importance of structuring the codes with different folder for different purpose
